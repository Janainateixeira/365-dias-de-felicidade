# Hello Janaina!
I hope you are fine.  

Unfortunatelly our class has turned into a new format, outside of the traditional class (not by our falt, of corse).  
But, however, I believe in your personal hability to learn by yourself and your project, at this point, shows it very well.

Let's talk about some points about your application:
- At first point, a lib named "@react-native-material/core" was not present on your application. I'm adding it now.
- I would suggest you, just do add a pattern on your code, to use english naming on your components.
- I suggest to remove the header of the main page.
- On your first screen, you are using just texts. If I understand right, you want to use, in truth, some inputs. To use it, I suggest you to use the following component:
> https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput
- I also suggest to verify the style of your application. I'm running your project on an iOS simulator and some things are being displayed desaligned. Please, check these docs:
> https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props
> https://reactnative.dev/docs/image.html#style
> https://reactnative.dev/docs/text.html#style
> https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox.html#content
> https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox.html#content
  
- Maybe, once your application will not have a backend, you can supress your first screen and use as main screen the screen that you can add the text as entry.
- Your application needs to save some data on the mobile phone. I suggest you to check these points:
> 1. Using the key-value model with AsyncStorage (3rd theme - 1st topic)
> 2. Using a relational database with SQLite (3rd theme - 2nd topic)
> 3. Using the Realm Database (3rd theme - 3rd topic)
> You can choose one of them or more.

### Next steps dates
[ ] Organize your application style and reorganize your screens: 10/11/2022.
[ ] Data store with your application: 24/11/2022.
